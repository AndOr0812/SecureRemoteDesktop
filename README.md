# SecureRemoteDesktop
Windows RDP is the most fast solution for remote desktop accessing, however it is very easy to hack, especially when accessing computer/server in the cloud. i had very bad experience of this disaster - the hacker break through my login password and encrypted my hard-disk asking for BitCoin ... That is why i wrote SecureRemoteDesktop, which might not be perfectly secure, however, it is an effort and it does provide a more secure way for remote desktop accessing. If you have more good ideas, please help to develop, and share with everyone who need this kind of tools:)
